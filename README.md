# ngu-decoder

This is a fork of [Bodrick's project](https://github.com/BodrickLight/ngu-decoder), but with analytics removed, and a link to the much better [ngu save analyser](http://www.ngusav.es.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/).
A decoder for NGU Idle save game files. Uses a (currently partial) implementation of [MS-NRBF](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/openspecs/windows_protocols/ms-nrbf/75b9fe09-be15-475f-85b8-ae7b7558cfe5).

This is NOT a save editor, only a decoder.
